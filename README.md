Hi, I’m @CansuIcli! 👋

I have studied both social sciences and natural sciences throughout my education life. ⚖️⚛️

My research interests are inherently broad ranging and expanding. 📚🌲✨

Also, I successfully completed hundreds of certified courses related to these interests from Harvard, MIT, Stanford, Google, IBM, Reuters, UiPath and more, and in connection with these interests, I am interested in Aerospace and Defense Industry Softwares, Military AI and Robots, Emerging Technologies Policy and Law, Data Analytics and Algorithms, Digital Transformation in Business & Media and Cybersecurity, Robotherapy and Generative Art on GitHub. 🦅✈️🤖🌌
