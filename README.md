Hi, I’m @CansuIcli! 👋

I have studied both social sciences and natural sciences throughout my education life. ⚖️⚛️

My research interests are inherently broad ranging and expanding. 📚🌲✨

Also, I successfully completed hundreds of certified courses related to these interests from Harvard, MIT, Stanford, Google, IBM, Reuters, UiPath and more, and in connection with these interests, I am interested in Aerospace and Defense Industry Softwares, Military AI and Robots, Emerging Technologies Policy and Law, Data Analytics and Algorithms in Politics, Digital Transformation and Cybersecurity, Robot Therapy and Generative Art on GitHub. 🦅✈️🤖🌌
